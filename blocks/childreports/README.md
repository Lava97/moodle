# Moodle Child Reports Block

The Child Reports block is supported and maintained by Lalit Chandwani https://github.com/Lava97

# PURPOSE

The Child Reports block allows a parent/mentor/tutor to maintain a record of grades and attendance(if attendance plugin is active) of the student. Before this block can be used, a parent/mentor/tutor - student relation must be established between 2 users. This can be done by following the steps given on the following link: https://docs.moodle.org/35/en/Parent_role

This block will be seen by parents/mentors/tutors and provides links to the student profile and a full report of the student.
